Notes on React V6
---------------------
src folder - to store source file
in index.html <div>root<div> the react start there


JSX --> hidden createElement and other fumctions
in react data flows downward  parent--> child. child don't know whos rendering and doesn't interact with it parent ever
npm - node package manager
npm is installed per project 
npm init -y (for setting npm in the current project)
package.json mainly manifest for the project (all the files and dependencies needed for project to work)

tools
-----
1.prettier -- automatic code formatter (every time we save it re-adjust space comas and all that kind of stuff for us) npm install -D prettier (-D dev dependency)
package-lock.json is created by installing prettier and makes all the team members to use prettier even they don't install it in vs code
package.json helps to excute script (Script is basically like a repository of shell commands that work inside of your project)
2.eslint -- eslint and prettier both take care of spacing but eslint deals more with syntax like , '' "" etc
eslint and prettier can work together (npm install -D eslint@7.18.0 eslint-config-prettier@8.1.0) -- to prevent bugs and unwanted codes
Parcel - bundler for js (npm install -D parcel@1.12.3)
parcel automatically sent NODE_ENV=development and all other stuff for us 
when pushing make to production so we can reduce the size by 1/4
babel- tool for automatically understand where react should be imported without importing it makes it easy for coding


---------------
JSX-easy coding,Hooks-state was implimented (never put hooks in for loop or if statement it may disorder execution)
hooks - we mainly use useState then useEffect
Error bounderies works with class component only not with function component
Modal and Context also been implemented to make website more attractive and to understand the concept
